# The Selkup morphophonological/twolc rules file 

This file documents the [phonology.twolc file](http://github.com/giellalt/lang-sel/blob/main/src/fst/phonology.twolc) 

Note: I don't have currently any idea about what all should be in Selkup alphabet
and how it all goes together. I have just added what I see in texts I use as a
starting point.





Rule: **ӈ to ӄ before ӄ, needs to be refined**
